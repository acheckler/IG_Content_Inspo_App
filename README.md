Social Media Content Curator

An application for social media professionals or the average user, for when the inspiration is there but the content isn't.
This app uses the Unsplash API and the QuoteGarden API to collect images and phrases to be used in social media posts or stories. The photos are returned with a link to their unsplash page, and all quotes are credited with their original author.
